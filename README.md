broccoli-wiredependencies
=========================

Provides an easy way to inject your projects javascript- or css-files in a broccoli build task.

## Installation

Install broccoli-wirdedependencies from npm registry:

	$npm i broccoli-wiredependencies --save-dev
	
Or install bleeding edge version from GitHub repo:

	$npm i git://github.com/andre-meier/broccoli-wiredependencies.git
	
## Usage

Like all broccoli plugins, `broccoli-wiredependencies` accepts an `inputTree` and an `options`-hash. 

```javascript
var wiredependencies = require('broccoli-inject-livereload');

var inputTree = 'src/';
var public = injectLivereload(inputTree, options);

```

`inputTree` *{Single tree}*

A Broccoli tree. A tree in Broccoli can be either a string that references a
directory in your project or a tree structure returned from running another
Broccoli plugin.

**Note:** `broccoli-wiredependencies` will return a new tree including your modified `src`-file and the wired javascript and css-files. If you want to include additional files in your output folder, you'll have to use [broccoli-merge-trees](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli-merge-trees).

###options

#### src
Type: *{String}*  
Default: *index.html*

The template file where you want to include your css and javascript files. The file must have the following comments which are replaced by the javascript- / css-inludes:

* For inclusion of you stylesheets:  `<!-- include:styles -->`  
* For inclusion of you javascript files  `<!-- include:scripts -->`

#### bower
Type: *{Boolean}*  
Default: *true*

Defines, whether or not you want `broccoli-wiredependencies` to wire up your bower-packages. Internally using [wiredep](https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep) to resolve your bower packages and their dependencies.

#### ignoreBowerStylesheets
Type: *{Boolean}*
Default: *true*

Defines, whether or not you want to wire up your sass or css from your bower dependencies. You may want to turn this on if you're using sass in include all your dependencies by hand.

#### paths

##### js:

Type: *{String}*  
Default: *js*

The path were your javascript-dependencies are copied to.

##### css:

Type: *{String}*
