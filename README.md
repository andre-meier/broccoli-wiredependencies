broccoli-wiredependencies
=========================

Provides an easy way to inject your projects javascript- or css-files in a broccoli build task.

## Installation

Install broccoli-wirdedependencies from npm registry:

	$npm i broccoli-wiredependencies --save-dev
	
Or install bleeding edge version from GitHub repo:

	$npm i git://github.com/andre-meier/broccoli-wiredependencies.git
	
## Usage

Like all broccoli plugins, `broccoli-wiredependencies` accepts an `inputTree` and an `options`-hash. 

```javascript
var wiredependencies = require('broccoli-inject-livereload');

var inputTree = 'src/';
var public = injectLivereload(inputTree, options);

```

`inputTree` *{Single tree}*

A Broccoli tree. A tree in Broccoli can be either a string that references a
directory in your project or a tree structure returned from running another
Broccoli plugin.

**Note:** `broccoli-wiredependencies` will return a new tree including your modified `src`-file and the wired javascript and css-files. If you want to include additional files in your output folder, you'll have to use [broccoli-merge-trees](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli-merge-trees).

###options

####src
Type: *{String}*  
Default: *index.html*

The template file where you want to include your css and javascript files. The file must have the following comments which are replaced by the javascript- / css-inludes:

* For inclusion of you stylesheets:  `<!-- include:styles -->`  
* For inclusion of you javascript files  `<!-- include:scripts -->`

####bower
Type: *{Boolean}*  
Default: *true*

Defines, whether or not you want `broccoli-wiredependencies` to wire up your bower-packages. Internally using [wiredep](https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep) to resolve your bower packages and their dependencies.

####cssIgnoreFiles
Type: *{Array}*

A list of css-files that should not be collected and injected to your `src`-file. Example: When using sass and the bootstrap bower package, you may not want `bootstrap.css` to be collected and included, since you'll import the sass in your `application.scss`.

####paths

#####js:

Type: *{String}*  
Default: *js*

The path were your javascript-dependencies are copied to.

#####css:

Type: *{String}*  
Default: *js*

The path were your stylesheet-dependencies are copied to.
